According to the document, fire safety units that are meant to accommodate people must have evacuation doors, unless there are other means of achieving the necessary safety level. The design and establishment of evacuation doors should take into account several factors. Firstly, the people in the room should be able to draw attention to themselves. Secondly, the number of people the room is intended to accommodate should be considered. Additionally, the evacuation doors should be usable for the rescue of people by firefighting personnel using ladders, depending on the height of the building. Lastly, the evacuation doors in fire safety units should be able to be opened without the need for keys or specialized equipment when people are present in those units.", "This document discusses the fire resistance requirements for load-bearing structures in buildings. It states that buildings and building parts must be adequately fire resistant to ensure safe evacuation, prevent material damage, and protect people and buildings on neighboring plots. The document also mentions that the emergency services must have secure options for searching and rescuing people, as well as carrying out necessary extinguishing measures. The fire resistance of load-bearing building parts can be determined using either a standard fire effect or a natural fire process. If the natural fire process is used, the structure's ability to resist the full fire process must be documented. Additionally, the document specifies that the load-bearing capacity during a fire must be determined according to Chapter 15, and building parts must be integrated to maintain the overall load-bearing capacity of the structure in case of a fire.

The document states that the supply of outdoor air should be limited during periods of reduced ventilation need and that the supply should be adaptable in rooms with varying ventilation needs. Ventilation systems with injection and evacuation must have a heat recovery solution. Only batteries with fluid couplings should be used if the separation of air flows is essential for room functions. However, the heat recovery requirement can be waived if the excess heat of the discharge air cannot be used effectively, such as in situations where cooling is required. The document also discusses specific electricity consumption limits for air transportation in various types of ventilation systems. It states that these limits do not apply to systems associated with industrial processes or systems with low electricity consumption. Ventilation systems with heat recovery used for one residential unit should have a minimum dry temperature efficiency of 80 percent.

This requirement applies to both regular ventilation and demand-controlled ventilation. The basic air exchange in the residential unit should be done through a ventilation system that injects air into residential rooms and evacuates air from the bathroom, toilet room, kitchen, and scullery. The ventilation system must also have heat recovery for heating the injected air. However, during seasons other than the designated period, outdoor air can be supplied through windows, air vents, etc.\n\nSection 3 of this chapter focuses on kitchens in residential units. It states that kitchens must have a range hood above the cooker. The range hood should have adjustable mechanical ventilation and evacuate air to the open air.
