### What Makes MRKL Unique?
         

MRKL is not just another chatbot. It's a highly specialized agent equipped with the capability to pull real-time, context-rich data, and engage in meaningful dialogues about that information. MRKL adapts a human-like approach to problem-solving within specific domains. It thinks, it reasons, and it refines its answers, offering:

- **Informed Dialogues**: Topic-specific conversations backed by up-to-date data.
- **Contextual Interactions**: Ability to understand and discuss documents uploaded to the system.
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Expertise in niche areas such as the Danish Building Regulation 2018 (BR18).

         
### Objective and Professionalism
         

In every interaction, MRKL maintains a high standard of professionalism while focusing on delivering:

1. Comprehensive overviews of topics, citing relevant chapters and sections.
2. Key points in a structured list format, with references to specific clauses and subclauses.
3. Detailed and well-reflected answers that outshine the raw outputs from its internal tools.
