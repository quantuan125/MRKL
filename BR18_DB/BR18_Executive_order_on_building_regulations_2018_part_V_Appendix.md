> X* For buildings in fire class 2, independent inspection of documentation must be carried out in relation to fire classification, declarations regarding whether the building is traditional in terms of contingency tactics, of the fire strategy report and the inspection plan, see ss. 510-512 and s. 518 (fire safety documentation). For structure class 2, the requirement for independent inspection only applies to A1. Structural basis and B2. Structural inspection plan, see s. 501, para (1) and s. 502(1), para (2). For the remaining part of the documentation, inspection may be carried out by persons who did not participate in the preparation of the documentation for the relevant structure/structural section, but who participated in the planning of the building.

> X stands for required.
