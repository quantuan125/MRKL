the plane and the exterior side of the roofing in a horizontal plane 1.50 metres above the finished floor
is included.
2) For open storeys, gates, airlocks, etc., the area up to the line defined by the outer walls of the building
is included.
3) In case of shared walls between to be included in separate floor areas, measurements are taken to the
middle of the wall. However, in case of shared walls placed over boundaries, the distance to the
boundary is measured.

456. Heights are measured from the natural ground level. For buildings on sloping ground or ground with
large level differences, measurements are carried out from one or more levels determined by the local
council. The location of the levels must be stated clearly in the building permit, e.g. by indication of
elevation numbers. If necessary, several levels can be indicated for the same plot.
(2) In the determination of levels, the local council must take the following into consideration:

building provided they are of usual size On the determination of the height of the building, the local
council may also decide to disregard stairwell buildings, elevator shafts, signs and luminous
advertising.
457. Distances are measured horizontally without consideration of differences in ground levels. The
distance is measured perpendicularly to the relevant opposite line (road line, boundary) or building, but to
account for light conditions or to limit views into the building, it may be measured as the minimum free
distance between the building or building part and the opposite road line, boundary or other buildings on
the same plot. In case of buildings without limiting outer walls, measurement is carried out from the roof
surface.
(2) In the determination of the distance between the building and the boundary, the following is
disregarded:

(2) For buildings with high ceilings where the surface of the building envelope divided by the floor area
is higher than 3, the volume flow though flaws may not exceed 0.15 l/s per sq. metre of building envelope.
(3) This requirement can be documented by pressure testing of the building or typical parts of large
buildings.
482. For floor areas where pressure testing is carried out of the volume flow though flaws, the test result
may be applied in the calculation of the energy demand for such areas. If documentation does not exist, 1.5
l/s per sq. metre at 50 Pa will be applied.
(2) Pressure testing must be carried out according to s. 263(5).
483. Ventilation systems in which the unit and ducting is only used in one residential unit must be

individual structural sections may be allocated to different structure classes.
486. A structural section for the purpose of this executive order is a limited part of a structure under one
planning organisation.
(2) A structural section may have one structure class and one consequence class.
487. The complexity of the structure must be determined as follows:
1) Simple structure: A structure for which lowering of load is easy, and balance conditions can be
determined in a simple way without special qualifications or tools.
2) Complex structure: A structure for which lowering of load may be difficult to assess, where
determination of balance conditions requires special qualifications or tools or where changes in the
precondition may be significant to the operation of the structure.
