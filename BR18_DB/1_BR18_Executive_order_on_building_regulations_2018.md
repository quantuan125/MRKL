251. Buildings must be planned, established, converted and maintained to ensure that the energy demand
does not exceed the energy framework, which includes the total demand of the building for energy supply
for heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot water and lighting. Energy supply from various energy
sources must added using the energy factors stated in ss. 252 and 253. Evidence must be provided based on
the instructions of the Danish Building Research Institute 213 Energy demand in buildings.
(2) For additions, changes in use, conversions, temporary movable pavilions and holiday homes, the
provisions of ss. 267-292 can be applied as an alternative to the energy framework.
252. In buildings the various sources must be weighted by calculation of the total energy demand
supplied. The following factors are applied:
1) 2.5 for electricity.
2) 0.80 for district heating. The district heating factor is 1.0 when the renovation classes are applied.

included in the heated floor area.


4) Process energy is not included in the calculation of the energy demand of buildings.

#### General minimum requirements for building envelopes

257. Each building part must be insulated to ensure that the heat loss coefficients do not exceed the values
stated in Appendix 2, Table 1. In certain cases, e.g. in case of tall buildings or complicated soil conditions,
the requirements for linear thermal transmittance at the foundation cannot be observed. In such cases, a
corresponding higher linear thermal transmittance coefficient can be accepted if problems with moisture
and condensation do not occur.
(2) Subsection 1 does not apply to ss. 267-270 and ss. 274-282.

#### General minimum requirements for windows, glass outer wall, skylights and glass roofs

2) For skylights and glass roofs, the energy balance for the reference window may not be lower than 0.0
kWh/sq. metre per year. The energy balance is calculated as Eref = 345 x gw – 90.36 x Uw.
3) Sound glass and other functional glass may be used if the reference windows fulfils the energy balance
requirement. However, glass with a lower solar heat transmittance (g value) may be used if energy
savings related to the solution can be proven.
(2) The reference dimensions for windows, glass outer walls, skylights and glass roofs is 1.23 metres x
1.48 metres. For glass outer wall and glass roofs, the energy balance is calculated from the centre lines of
the profile system.

(3) For non-residential buildings not subject to s. 259 or building sections in such buildings which require
a high illumination level, extra ventilation, large consumption of domestic hot water or a long usage period or buildings with large headroom, the energy framework is increased by an amount corresponding to the calculated energy consumption for the relevant purpose. The increase is calculated in accordance with the instructions of the Danish Building Research Institute 213 Energy demand in buildings.

#### Requirements for the use of energy frameworks

261. In buildings with various uses which can be referenced to different energy frameworks, the total
heated floor area of the building is divided into building sections for the same use. This division is applied
in the determination of the energy framework for the entire building.
262. For buildings with various uses where the main use constitutes minimum 80 per cent of the total
floor area, the use is considered to be the main use.
263. The volume flow through flaws in the building envelope in new buildings heated to minimum 15 °C
must not exceed 1.0 l/s per sq. metre heated floor areas at a difference in pressure of 50 Pa.
(2) For buildings with high ceilings where the surface of the building envelope divided by the floor area
is higher than 3, requirements demanding that the volume flow though flaws are does not exceed 0.3 l/s per
sq. metre of building envelope can be applied as an alternative to s. 263(1).
(3) Documentation of flaws in the building envelope can be provided via pressure testing of the building
or typical parts of large buildings.
(4) For floor areas where pressure testing is carried out of the volume flow though flaws, the test result
may be applied in the calculation of the energy demand for such areas. If documentation does not exist, 1.5
l/s per sq. metre at 50 Pa will be applied.
(5) Pressure testing of the volume flow through flaws in the building envelope must be carried out based
on Method 3 of DS/EN ISO 9972 Thermal capacity of buildings - Determination of air permeability in
buildings - Test method using positive pressure generated by a ventilator. Handling of holes in the building
envelope by pressure testing is described in the Guidelines of the Building Regulation on energy
consumption. The result of the pressure test is expressed by the average measurement at positive pressure
and negative pressure.

ensures that the rated transmission loss per sq. metre of building envelope does not exceed 4.0 W for one-
storey buildings, 5.0 W for two-storey buildings and 6.0 W for buildings of 3 storeys or more. The area
covered by windows, skylights, glass roofs and doors and the transmission loss via those surfaces are not
included in the calculation. However, heat loss via insulated sections of windows, skylights, glass roofs and
glass outer walls are included in the rated transmission loss.
265. Systems renewable energy in or adjacent to buildings may be included in the energy framework
calculation of the building in question. If a new building is established with a shared renewable energy
system for the building, this system may be included in the energy framework calculation provided that is
was established for the supply of energy to the building in question, and that it is located near the building.
(2) For all buildings, electricity production from renewable energy systems such as solar panels or wind
turbines may be included in the energy framework at a maximum corresponding to a reduction of the energy
supply demand of 25 kWh/sq. metre per year.


266. For heated or partly heated basements which are not included in the floor area, 50 per cent of the
basement area will be included in the energy framework. No area is added for unheated basements.

#### Energy demand on change of use

267. In case of changes in use of a building or parts of a building which results in a significant increase
in energy consumption, the energy demands may be observed by using the energy framework in ss. 259-
266 or by following the requirements for U values in s. 268.
268. Building parts adjacent to heated rooms must be established with heat loss coefficients
corresponding to the temperature to which the rooms are heated stated in Appendix 2, Table 2. Windows,
glass outer walls, glass roofs and skylights must fulfil the requirements stated in ss. 257 and 258.
269. In case of changes in use of a building or parts of a building, structural circumstances may result in
failure to fully observe s. 268. In that case, the missing capacity must be replaced by other energy solutions
which compensate for this failure.
270. Structural changes must be in accordance with the requirements in s. 268. Changes which result in
an increase in energy consumption may be carried out provided equivalent compensating energy savings
are carried out.

#### Energy demand for additions

271. Additions must be planned and established in a way which ensures that the energy demand does not
exceed the energy framework on calculation. If the energy framework is used for additions, the energy
framework only applies to the addition. The size of the energy framework for the addition is calculated
based on the area of the entire building. Alternatively, the requirements may be observed by observing the
U values stipulated in s. 268 or the heat loss framework stipulated in s. 272. It is a condition of the use of
the U values in s. 268 that the total area of outer doors and windows, including skylights, dome lights, glass
outer walls and glass roofs does not exceed 22 per cent of the total heated floor area.
272. The heat loss framework may be applied to additions if the heat loss of the addition does not exceed
the heat loss which would have occurred if the U value requirements in s. 268 had been complied with.
(2) In this context, the heat loss framework only includes the addition. However, 50 per cent of the
previous heat loss through the part of the facade on the existing building which is covered by the addition
may be included in the heat loss framework.

2 73. Windows in the addition may be included in the heat loss framework as the actual windows or
windows with a U value of 1.2 W/sq. metre K. The actual windows must be used in the calculation of the
real conditions.


#### Energy demand in relation to conversions and replacement of building parts

274. In conversions, energy savings must be carried out to the extent that they are financially viable and
do not involve a risk of moisture damage. The energy demands in conversions may either be observed by
fulfilling the requirements for all building parts affected in s. 279 or by observing the renovation classes for
existing buildings in
ss. 280-282. The renovation classes constitute an energy framework for existing buildings.
275. Conversions for which the annual savings times useful life divided by investment exceeds 1,33 are
considered financially viable. If conversions are not financially viable, the lack of financial viability must
be proven. If a conversion is not financially viable, it should be determined if a smaller conversion would
be viable.
(2) In structures with room for insulation, e.g. sloping roofs with rafters, examinations must first be
carried out to determine if insulation of the cavities are financially viable and then if reinsulation according
to the requirements in s. 279 is financially viable.
276. Changes to buildings which involve an increase in energy consumption may be carried out if
corresponding compensating energy savings are carried out.
277. If building parts or installations are replaced, the provisions in s. 279 and the installation parts must
be maintained irrespective of their financial viability. However, there may be cases, e.g. in connection with
concreting of foundations when replacement would result in additional costs related to adjacent building
parts which are so substantial that the replacement is not financially viable under s. 275. In the calculation
of financial viability, only costs related to adjacent building parts are included in the calculation.
278. Churches and additions which form part of a listed ancient monument are exempt from the provisions
of ss. 274-282.
(2) Listed buildings are exempt from the provisions of ss. 274-282 if observing the energy requirements
in ss. 274-282 would be contrary to the architectural, cultural, historical or environmental values of the
listed building.
(3) Buildings worthy of preservation which are included in a local preservation planning regulation or a
registered preservation declaration or buildings appointed in the municipal plan as being worthy of
preservation under s. 19(1) of the Danish Act on Listed Buildings are also exempt from the provisions in
ss. 274-282 if observation of the requirement would be contrary to the plan or appointment in question.
279. Conversion or other changes to the building must be in accordance with the requirements for U
values and linear thermal transmittance stated in Appendix 2, Table 3. Windows, glass outer walls, glass
roofs and skylights must fulfil the requirements stated in ss. 257 and 258.

per year divided by the heated floor area.
2) Renovation class 1 when the total energy supply demand for heating, ventilation, cooling and domestic
hot water per sq. metre heated floor area does not exceed 52.5 kWh/sq. metre per year plus 1,650 kWh
per year divided by the heated floor area.
282. Offices, schools, institutions and other buildings not subject to s. 281 may be classified as:
1) Renovation class 2 when the total energy supply demand for heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot
water and lighting per sq. metre heated floor area does not exceed 135 kWh/sq. metre per year plus
3,200 kWh per year divided by the heated floor area.
2) Renovation class 1 when the total energy supply demand for heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot
water and lighting per sq. metre heated floor area does not exceed 71.3 kWh/sq. metre per year plus
1,650 kWh per year divided by the heated floor area.
(2) For buildings and building sections which require a high level of illumination, extra ventilation, large
consumption of domestic hot water or a long period of usage or buildings with large headroom, the energy
framework is increased by an amount corresponding to the energy consumption calculated for this purpose.
The instructions of the Danish Building Research Institute 213 Energy demand in buildings stipulate the
conditions for those increased amounts.

#### Holiday homes, camping cabins and similar holiday accommodation

283. Holiday homes, camping cabins and similar holiday accommodation and adjacent outbuildings must
fulfil the requirements for U values and linear thermal transmittance stated in Appendix 2, Table 4.

windows and outer doors, including skylights and dome lights, glass outer walls, glass roofs and hatches
opening to the outside constitute maximum 30 per cent of the heated floor area.

```
(2) These values can be derogated from if the resulting total heat loss does not increase.
```
285. For conversion, other changes and replacements, the requirements stated in s. 283 apply on the
condition that the requirements are financially viable. Financial viability must be determined according to
s. 275. In the assessment of financial viability the holiday home is considered also to be in use during the
winter months.
286. In holiday homes, solid outer walls of e.g. wood, aerated concrete or brick with a U value lower than
0.50 W/m²K may be used on the condition that the total heat transmission heat loss will not be higher
compared to the use of the U values in s. 283.


#### Temporary movable pavilions

287. Temporary movable pavilions must be erected in order to avoid unnecessary energy consumption in
due consideration of the use of the pavilions. Temporary movable pavilions are structures which are set up
for a period of 0-5 years, and they typically consist of a number of pavilion modules which are set up e.g.
during a renovation process at a school, a day-care facility or an office building as a solution to an acute
need for space, including reaccommodation.
(2) Permanent pavilions or pavilions used for more than 5 years must fulfil the relevant requirements for
new buildings.
288. Pavilions set up for temporary use must fulfil the requirements for U values and linear thermal
transmittance stated in Appendix 2, Table 5. New windows, glass walls, glass roofs and skylights must
fulfil the requirements stated in
ss. 257 and 258.
289. It is a condition for use of U values and linear thermal transmittance that the total area of windows
and doors does not exceed 22 per cent of the heated floor area. U values and linear thermal transmittance
may change and the window area, etc. may be increased if the heat loss of the pavilion does not increase
compared to compliance with the requirements in the table. Windows may be included in the heat loss
framework as the actual windows or windows with a U value of 1.5 W/sq. metre K. The actual windows
must be used in the calculation of the real conditions.
290. Use of direct electric heating is allowed for temporary movable pavilions for installations to be used
for up to 2 years. For installations to be used for 2 to 5 years, direct electric heating must be replaced by
other heating supply, or compensation must be provided by establishing a corresponding production of
renewable energy.
291. New pavilion modules must be ready for other heating sources than direct electric heating. For
example, they could be ready for water heating.

294. In buildings located in area where connection to a district heating supply grid is possible, buildings
may be heated by district heating irrespective of s. 293.
295. In buildings located in area where a natural gas supply grid is established, or were a project approval
prepared before 1 January 2013 exists on individual natural gas supply in the area under the Danish Act on
Heating Supply , heating of buildings may be based on natural gas irrespective of s. 293.


296. Existing buildings located in areas where connection to a district heating supply grid is not possible,
or where a natural gas supply grid has not been established or adopted under the Danish Act on Heating
Supply before 1 January 2013, see s. 295, are not subject to s. 293.
297. Exemption from s. 293 can only be granted if a specific assessment of conditions concerning the
building or property determines that heating of the building by renewable energy is not suitable. In case of
an exemption, the local council may e.g. emphasise that one or more of the following factors make
installation of renewable energy for the specific building unsuitable:
1) Plot size.
2) Location of the building on the plot.
3) Neighbour considerations.
4) Local development plans for district heating.
5) The planned use of the building.
298. In new and existing buildings where heating is not based on renewable energy in accordance with s.
293, and where material conversions or alterations are carried out, renewable energy must constitute part
of the total energy supply for the building to the extent this is technically possible and financially viable.
Financial viability is assessed according to s. 275. This provision does not apply to renovation of churches,
