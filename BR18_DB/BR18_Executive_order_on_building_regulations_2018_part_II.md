52. Outer doors must have a free width for passage of minimum 0.77 metres. On the side of the door that
opens towards the person, there should be minimum 0.50 metres of free space next to the door opposite the
hinged side.
53. Ss. 51 and 52 also apply to doors for escape routes in the ground floor, garden, balcony and terrace
doors and shared roof terraces for which access is possible via lift, etc.
54. In residential areas, parking areas and any areas for refuse collection adjoining the building, access
conditions must be available which ensure that the users can access the areas and use their functions
unassisted.

#### Shared access routes in the building

55. The users must be able to move from outside the building or via shared access routes in the building
to the functions in the building unassisted.
56. Shared access routes leading to two or more dwellings, offices, meeting rooms, exhibitions, sales
areas or other units or functions in each floor which includes wind screens, ante-rooms, access balconies,
galleries, spaces outside lifts, ramps and landings in and outside the building and including outside access
areas for basements must be planned and constructed as described below:
1) Direct and unhindered access to lifts, residential units and functions in commercial buildings and
shared spaces including outside living spaces on each floor.
2) Its width must be sufficient for its use, and unhindered passage in its full width must be possible. The
free width must be minimum 1.30 metres.
3) They must be marked using deviating materials, colours or lighting.
4) Any differences in level or height must be eliminated with ramps. Ramps may not be installed with a
gradient over 1:20 (5 centimetres per metre) , and there must be a horizontal area of minimum 1.
metres x 1.30 metres before and after the ramp. Ramps levelling differences in height of over 0.
metres must also have a horizontal landing for each 0.60 metres rise. Ramps must be equipped with
hand rails. For ramps with a gradient of 1:25 (4 centimetres per metre) or less, hand rails can be omitted.
5) Door in shared access routes must have a free width for passage of minimum 0.77 metres. On the side
of the door that opens towards the person, there should be minimum 0.50 metres of free space next to
the door opposite the hinged side.
6) Door steps may not be higher than 2.50 centimetres.


#### Stairs

57. Stairs in shared access routes must be established with sufficient width and headroom for their
intended use. This provision is considered to be fulfilled when:
1) The free width of the stairs is minimum 1.0 metre, and the free headroom measured in the middle of
the passage route of the stairs is minimum 2.10 metres.
2) Stairs have a gradient which makes them easy and safe to walk on. The gradient of the stairs (the
vertical height of the steps) does not exceed 0.18 metres.
3) The going (the horizontal depth of the step) on straight run, quarter turn and half turn staircases is not
less than 0.
metres. In residential buildings, minimum 0.25 metres.
4) On circular and winding staircases the going may not be less than 0.20 metres.

#### Fencing

58. Corridors, staircases and ramps in shared access routes and balconies, French windows, balcony
corridors, air locks, roof terraces, outside staircases and other elevated residential areas must be protected
with fencing and equipped with hand rails with due consideration of the use of the building. With due
consideration of the use of the building, all types of fencing or railings must be designed in to ensure that
their height and design, openings in the fencing, etc. protect persons from falling over or through them.
This provision is considered to be fulfilled when:
1) The height of fencing or railings is minimum 1.0 metre.
2) The height of fencing at staircases and ramps is minimum 0.80 metres and 0.90 metres over landings.

is minimum 1.20 metres.
4) The height of fencing must be measured over the front edge of the steps and from the top edge of the
floor/deck.
5) Hand rails must be easy to grasp and hold on to.
59. Fencing must be designed with a distance between all types of baluster, vertical as well as horizontal,
which does not cause personal injuries. In that connection, particular focus should be on ensuring that
children cannot climb onto the guard or get pinched between balusters.
60. Fencing made from glass must be constructed in accordance with ss. 238-241.

#### Hand rails

61. Corridors, stairs and ramps in shared access routes must be equipped with grip-friendly hand rails
which are easy to grip and hold on to in the sides not equipped with fencing. Hand rails must be installed
without interruption over landings and must be terminated horizontally.

#### Information

62. In building open to the public which offers citizen services, important information about the layout
and use of the building must be easy to read and understand.
(2) Subsection 1 includes information at the entrance to the building and directions to important functions
in the building such as lavatories, disabled lavatories, lifts, stairs, distribution routes, etc.
(3) With due consideration of the use of the building, this information must be provided in Braille, sound
and pictograms, writing and graphics in relief and guiding lines.


### Chapter 3 - Refuse systems

63. Buildings and areas surrounding buildings must be designed to enable the users to dispose of refuse
from each unit in the buildings and on the grounds near the main entrances to the building.
64. Facilities for hygienic disposal of household waste until it is collected must be available in the building
or on the plot.
(2) The design, construction, operation and maintenance of refuse systems must be carried out in a way
which ensures that:
1) No health risks for people will occur.
2) No comfort-related nuisance such as noise and smell will occur.
3) Source-separated sorting must be possible.
4) No unnecessary use of energy will occur.
65. The waste systems must be arranged so that the users can use them unassisted.
66. Waste bins, boxes, etc. must be located on the same level as the access road for refuse collection
vehicles in order to ensure that waste can be collected using technically appropriate means.
67. Refuse rooms must be designed and constructed with sufficient ventilation. This requirement will be
fulfilled when:
1) Outside air is supplied via a grille or other opening into open air at floor level. The open area should be
able to provide an air volume corresponding to the air volume which is evacuated. If an air inlet system
is used, the inlet flow must correspond to the evacuation flow.
2) The evacuation system has a total volume flow of 1 l/s per waste bin, minimum 15 l/s.
68. Refuse systems, including waste chutes, must be planned and constructed to ensure that the system
chosen is sufficiently ventilated.
