### Chapter 11 - Energy consumption

250. Buildings must be planned, established, converted and maintained in order to avoid unnecessary
consumption of energy for heating, domestic hot water, cooling, ventilation and lighting with due respect
of the use of the building and the scope of the building work.
251. Buildings must be planned, established, converted and maintained to ensure that the energy demand
does not exceed the energy framework, which includes the total demand of the building for energy supply
for heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot water and lighting. Energy supply from various energy
sources must added using the energy factors stated in ss. 252 and 253. Evidence must be provided based on
the instructions of the Danish Building Research Institute 213 Energy demand in buildings.
(2) For additions, changes in use, conversions, temporary movable pavilions and holiday homes, the
provisions of ss. 267-292 can be applied as an alternative to the energy framework.
252. In buildings the various sources must be weighted by calculation of the total energy demand
supplied. The following factors are applied:
1) 2.5 for electricity.
2) 0.80 for district heating. The district heating factor is 1.0 when the renovation classes are applied.
3) For other heating sources a factor of 1.0 and the relevant efficiency are applied.
253. When a new building is connected to an existing boiler which also supplies existing boilers, a factor
of 1.0 is applied. In connection with the use of waste heat from production plant and similar installations
the district heating factor is applied.
254. The following applies for the rooms or buildings stated below:
1) Building parts adjacent to rooms for which waste heat is supplied, e.g. boiler rooms and bakeries,
must be insulated according to their use.
2) Building parts adjacent to rooms which are not or which are only briefly heated to a temperature
above 5 °C, must be insulated according to their use.
3) Unheated buildings or buildings heated to temperatures below 5 °C are not required to fulfil the
requirements for heating insulation.

parts hereof which are heated. Only rooms which are included in the floor area of the building may be
included in the heated floor area.


4) Process energy is not included in the calculation of the energy demand of buildings.

#### General minimum requirements for building envelopes

257. Each building part must be insulated to ensure that the heat loss coefficients do not exceed the values
stated in Appendix 2, Table 1. In certain cases, e.g. in case of tall buildings or complicated soil conditions,
the requirements for linear thermal transmittance at the foundation cannot be observed. In such cases, a
corresponding higher linear thermal transmittance coefficient can be accepted if problems with moisture
and condensation do not occur.
(2) Subsection 1 does not apply to ss. 267-270 and ss. 274-282.

#### General minimum requirements for windows, glass outer wall, skylights and glass roofs

258. Windows, glass outer walls, skylights and glass roofs must be in accordance with the following
requirements for energy performance:
1) For windows and glass outer walls, the energy balance for the reference window may not be lower than
- 17.0 kWh/sq. metre per year. The energy balance is calculated as Eref = 196.4 x gw – 90.36 x Uw.
2) For skylights and glass roofs, the energy balance for the reference window may not be lower than 0.0
kWh/sq. metre per year. The energy balance is calculated as Eref = 345 x gw – 90.36 x Uw.
3) Sound glass and other functional glass may be used if the reference windows fulfils the energy balance
requirement. However, glass with a lower solar heat transmittance (g value) may be used if energy
savings related to the solution can be proven.
(2) The reference dimensions for windows, glass outer walls, skylights and glass roofs is 1.23 metres x
1.48 metres. For glass outer wall and glass roofs, the energy balance is calculated from the centre lines of
the profile system.

#### Energy frameworks for residential units, halls of residence, hotels, etc.

259. For residential units, halls of residence, hotels, etc. the total energy supply demand of the building
for heating, ventilation, cooling and domestic hot water per sq. metre heated floor area may not exceed 30.0
kWh/sq. metre per year plus 1,000 kWh per year divided by the heated floor area.

#### Energy frameworks for non-residential buildings

260. For non-residential buildings which are not subject to s. 259 the total energy supply demand of the
building for heating, ventilation, cooling, domestic hot water and lighting per sq. metre heated floor area
may not exceed 41.0 kWh/sq. metre per year plus 1,000 kWh per year divided by the heated floor area.
(2) For non-residential buildings not subject to s. 259 which are heated to a temperature between 5.0 and
15.0
°C, the calculation will be carried out based on a room temperature of 15 °C.
(3) For non-residential buildings not subject to s. 259 or building sections in such buildings which require
a high illumination level, extra ventilation, large consumption of domestic hot water or a long usage period


or buildings with large headroom, the energy framework is increased by an amount corresponding to the
calculated energy consumption for the relevant purpose. The increase is calculated in accordance with the
instructions of the Danish Building Research Institute 213 Energy demand in buildings.

#### Requirements for the use of energy frameworks

261. In buildings with various uses which can be referenced to different energy frameworks, the total
heated floor area of the building is divided into building sections for the same use. This division is applied
in the determination of the energy framework for the entire building.
262. For buildings with various uses where the main use constitutes minimum 80 per cent of the total
floor area, the use is considered to be the main use.
263. The volume flow through flaws in the building envelope in new buildings heated to minimum 15 °C
must not exceed 1.0 l/s per sq. metre heated floor areas at a difference in pressure of 50 Pa.
(2) For buildings with high ceilings where the surface of the building envelope divided by the floor area
is higher than 3, requirements demanding that the volume flow though flaws are does not exceed 0.3 l/s per
sq. metre of building envelope can be applied as an alternative to s. 263(1).
(3) Documentation of flaws in the building envelope can be provided via pressure testing of the building
or typical parts of large buildings.
(4) For floor areas where pressure testing is carried out of the volume flow though flaws, the test result
may be applied in the calculation of the energy demand for such areas. If documentation does not exist, 1.5
l/s per sq. metre at 50 Pa will be applied.
(5) Pressure testing of the volume flow through flaws in the building envelope must be carried out based
on Method 3 of DS/EN ISO 9972 Thermal capacity of buildings - Determination of air permeability in
buildings - Test method using positive pressure generated by a ventilator. Handling of holes in the building
envelope by pressure testing is described in the Guidelines of the Building Regulation on energy
consumption. The result of the pressure test is expressed by the average measurement at positive pressure
and negative pressure.
264. New buildings subject to the provisions of ss. 259 and 260 must be established in a way which
ensures that the rated transmission loss per sq. metre of building envelope does not exceed 4.0 W for one-
storey buildings, 5.0 W for two-storey buildings and 6.0 W for buildings of 3 storeys or more. The area
covered by windows, skylights, glass roofs and doors and the transmission loss via those surfaces are not
included in the calculation. However, heat loss via insulated sections of windows, skylights, glass roofs and
glass outer walls are included in the rated transmission loss.
265. Systems renewable energy in or adjacent to buildings may be included in the energy framework
calculation of the building in question. If a new building is established with a shared renewable energy
system for the building, this system may be included in the energy framework calculation provided that is
was established for the supply of energy to the building in question, and that it is located near the building.
(2) For all buildings, electricity production from renewable energy systems such as solar panels or wind
turbines may be included in the energy framework at a maximum corresponding to a reduction of the energy
supply demand of 25 kWh/sq. metre per year.


266. For heated or partly heated basements which are not included in the floor area, 50 per cent of the
basement area will be included in the energy framework. No area is added for unheated basements.

#### Energy demand on change of use

267. In case of changes in use of a building or parts of a building which results in a significant increase
in energy consumption, the energy demands may be observed by using the energy framework in ss. 259-
266 or by following the requirements for U values in s. 268.
268. Building parts adjacent to heated rooms must be established with heat loss coefficients
corresponding to the temperature to which the rooms are heated stated in Appendix 2, Table 2. Windows,
glass outer walls, glass roofs and skylights must fulfil the requirements stated in ss. 257 and 258.
269. In case of changes in use of a building or parts of a building, structural circumstances may result in
failure to fully observe s. 268. In that case, the missing capacity must be replaced by other energy solutions
which compensate for this failure.
270. Structural changes must be in accordance with the requirements in s. 268. Changes which result in
an increase in energy consumption may be carried out provided equivalent compensating energy savings
are carried out.

#### Energy demand for additions

271. Additions must be planned and established in a way which ensures that the energy demand does not
exceed the energy framework on calculation. If the energy framework is used for additions, the energy
framework only applies to the addition. The size of the energy framework for the addition is calculated
based on the area of the entire building. Alternatively, the requirements may be observed by observing the
U values stipulated in s. 268 or the heat loss framework stipulated in s. 272. It is a condition of the use of
the U values in s. 268 that the total area of outer doors and windows, including skylights, dome lights, glass
outer walls and glass roofs does not exceed 22 per cent of the total heated floor area.
272. The heat loss framework may be applied to additions if the heat loss of the addition does not exceed
the heat loss which would have occurred if the U value requirements in s. 268 had been complied with.
(2) In this context, the heat loss framework only includes the addition. However, 50 per cent of the
previous heat loss through the part of the facade on the existing building which is covered by the addition
may be included in the heat loss framework.

2 73. Windows in the addition may be included in the heat loss framework as the actual windows or
windows with a U value of 1.2 W/sq. metre K. The actual windows must be used in the calculation of the
real conditions.


#### Energy demand in relation to conversions and replacement of building parts

274. In conversions, energy savings must be carried out to the extent that they are financially viable and
do not involve a risk of moisture damage. The energy demands in conversions may either be observed by
fulfilling the requirements for all building parts affected in s. 279 or by observing the renovation classes for
existing buildings in
ss. 280-282. The renovation classes constitute an energy framework for existing buildings.
275. Conversions for which the annual savings times useful life divided by investment exceeds 1,33 are
considered financially viable. If conversions are not financially viable, the lack of financial viability must
be proven. If a conversion is not financially viable, it should be determined if a smaller conversion would
be viable.
(2) In structures with room for insulation, e.g. sloping roofs with rafters, examinations must first be
carried out to determine if insulation of the cavities are financially viable and then if reinsulation according
to the requirements in s. 279 is financially viable.
276. Changes to buildings which involve an increase in energy consumption may be carried out if
corresponding compensating energy savings are carried out.
277. If building parts or installations are replaced, the provisions in s. 279 and the installation parts must
be maintained irrespective of their financial viability. However, there may be cases, e.g. in connection with
concreting of foundations when replacement would result in additional costs related to adjacent building
parts which are so substantial that the replacement is not financially viable under s. 275. In the calculation
of financial viability, only costs related to adjacent building parts are included in the calculation.

440. S. 439 does not apply if an existing ventilation system is extended to include other rooms in the
building.
441. In ventilation systems where the heat consumption for heating surfaces exceeds 10,000 kWh per
year, the heating consumption must be metered. The electricity consumption of electric heating surfaces
where the total consumption exceeds 3,000 kWh per year must be metered. This provision applies to new
buildings and new installations in existing buildings.
442. Meters used for measuring electricity consumption or heating under ss. 438, 439 and 441 must have
a satisfactory accuracy.

#### Ventilation in residential buildings

443. In residential rooms as well as throughout the residential unit, supply of outdoor air must be present
at any time at minimum 0.30 l/s per sq. metre heated floor area. This provision also applies to demand-
controlled ventilation.
(2) The basic air exchange of the residential unit must be carried out by means of a ventilation system
with injection into to residential rooms and evacuation in bathroom, toilet room, kitchen and scullery. The
ventilation system must be equipped with heat recovery for heating of the injection air. Outside the season,
injection may be replaced by supply of outdoor air though windows, air vents, etc.
(3) Kitchens in residential units must be equipped with a range hood over the cooker. The range hood
must have adjustable, mechanical ventilation and evacuation into open air and have sufficient efficiency
for the removal of moisture and airborne pollution from cooking. The evacuation should be adjustable to
minimum 20 l/s.
(4) Evacuation from bathrooms and toilet rooms in residential units should be adjustable to minimum 15
l/s. In toilet rooms without bath/shower and sculleries, evacuation should be adjustable to minimum 10 l/s.
444. Evacuation from basements in single-family houses should be adjustable to minimum 10 l/s. For
other types of residential buildings than single-family houses, ventilation from the basement should be
dimensioned according to the size and use of the room.
445. For other rooms in residential buildings than those stated in ss. 443 and 444, the dimensioning of
the ventilation must be carried out in consideration of the size and use of the room.


446. Single-family houses may be ventilated via natural ventilation or a combination of natural and
mechanical ventilation. Single-family houses with natural ventilation are subject to s. 443(1) and (3).

#### Ventilation of day-care facilities and teaching rooms

447. Living spaces in day-care facilities, teaching rooms in schools, etc. must be ventilated via a
ventilation system which includes injection, evacuation and heat recovery for heating of the injection air.
(2) In day-care facilities, injection of outdoor air and evacuation must be minimum 3.0 l/s per child and
minimum 5.0 l/s per adult and 0.35 l/s per sq. metre floor area. In teaching rooms in schools, etc., the
injection of outdoor air and evacuation must be minimum 5.0 l/s per person and 0.35 l/s per sq. metre floor
area. In day-care facilities and teaching rooms in schools, etc. it must also be ensured that the maximum
CO2 content of the indoor air does not exceed 1,000 ppm for the dimensioned conditions.
(3) In a ventilation system with demand-controlled ventilation is used, the stated air quantities can be
derogated from when the demand is reduced. During the period of use, ventilation may not be less than 0.35
l/s per sq. metre floor area.

#### Ventilation of other buildings and rooms

448. Garages with a floor area over 150 sq. metres must be equipped with an independent mechanical
ventilation system for the removal of fumes and carbon monoxide.
449. For other rooms than those stated in ss. 443-447, the dimensioning of the ventilation must be
carried out in consideration of the size and use of the room.

#### Inspection

450. Function testing must be carried out of the ventilation system before it is put into use. The function
testing is intended to verify that the ventilation system complies with the requirements in the Building
Regulations for specific electricity consumption for air transport of air volumes and that any demand control
is functioning according to its purpose.

#### Operation and maintenance

451. Cleaning, operation and maintenance of ventilations systems must be carried out in order to maintain
a technically and hygienically safe condition and to ensure that they are always in accordance with the
provisions of ss. 421-449. Cleaning, operation and maintenance of ventilation systems must be carried out
as stipulated in DS 447 Ventilation in buildings _–_ Mechanical, natural and hybrid ventilation systems.
452. Operation and maintenance instructions for ventilation systems must be available when the system
is put into use. The instruction must include drawings with indication of the location of installations which
require maintenance and maintenance intervals. The operation and maintenance instruction must be
prepared as stipulated in DS 447, Ventilation in buildings _–_ Mechanical, natural and hybrid ventilation
systems.
